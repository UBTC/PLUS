PLUS
====

PLUS is an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) configuration for researchers, which is inspired by
    [Aaron Bedra's emacs.d](https://github.com/abedra/emacs.d) and [Bin Chen's emacs.d](https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d).

## Directory structure
- `~/.emacs.d/init.el` is the configuration entrance.
- `~/.emacs.d/custom.el` includes user's personal configurations (`custom.org` also works).
- `~/.emacs.d/sitelisp/` collects the packages that are NOT maintained by package manager `ELPA`.
- `~/.emacs.d/snippets/` collects [the official `Snippets` of `YASnippet`](https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets).
- `~/.emacs.d/elpa/` and the other things will be auto-maintained by `ELPA` or the other packages.

## Modules
**Golang, R, Python, Julia, LaTeX, markdown, orgmode, pandoc, gnuplot, Scala and Kotlin are supported**

# Installation
1. Backup the current `Emacs` configuration, e.g., the file `~/.emacs` or the folder `~/.emacs.d/`.
1. Uninstall all systematic `Emacs` plugins. All plugins will be placed at `~/.emacs.d` from now on.
1. Clone `PLUS`

    `cd ~; git clone https://github.com/ubtc/plus.git ~/.emacs.d; cd -`

1. Run the following command to fetch the latest packages from remote package repositories:

    `emacs -nw --batch -l ~/.emacs.d/init.el -f package-refresh-contents`

1. That's all.

## Third party tools installation (OPTIONAL)
External applications are optional, and can be installed through OS package managers, i.e.,
- [apt-cyg](https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg) for `Cygwin`,
- [homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) for `Mac`, and
- various `Linux` package managers (`apt` for `Ubuntu`, `yum` for `Redhat`, `pacman` for `Arch`, `emerge` for `Gentoo`, etc.)

### Golang

- install through OS package manager

### Python (and JEDI, Flake8, importmagic)
- needed by `python-mode`
- install through OS package manager or `pip/pip3`

### R
- needed by `ess`
- install through OS package manager

### Scala (and sbt)
- needed by `ensime-mode/scala-mode-hook`
